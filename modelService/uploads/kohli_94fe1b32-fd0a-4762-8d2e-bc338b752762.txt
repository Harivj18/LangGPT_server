India has given to the world many a great cricketer but none as ambitious as Virat Kohli. To meet his ambition, Kohli employed the technical assiduousness of Sachin Tendulkar and fitness that was in the league of top athletes in the world, not just cricketers. As a result, Kohli became the most consistent all-format accumulator of his time, making jaw-dropping chases look easy, and finding, in his own words, the safest possible way to score runs. Plenty of them.

This ambition transferred seamlessly to his captaincy: he demanded more than ever before of his bowlers, especially the quick ones, often sacrificed a batter for bowling depth, and led India to a long stay at No. 1 in the Test rankings and a first-ever Test series win in Australia. India won 40 out of the 68 Tests in which Kohli led, making him the fourth-most successful captain in the world, behind Graeme Smith, Ricky Ponting and Steve Waugh.

Kohli scored Test hundreds in and against every country he played, other than in Bangladesh. He smashed records for number of matches taken to reach eight, nine, ten and eleven thousand ODI runs, and became the first batter to score 50 hundreds in ODIs - getting to the milestone in the 2023 World Cup semi-final, in the presence of Tendulkar, the man whose record he broke.

Between 2016 and 2018, Kohli scored 3596 runs in 35 Tests at an average of 66.59, with 14 hundreds and eight fifties in 58 innings, with the 2018 tour of England being a high point. There was a dip thereafter - his average, over 55 at its peak after he scored his career-best of 254 against South Africa in Pune in 2019, slipped to around 46 by the end.

He retired from Test cricket midway through IPL 2025. Fans turned up in whites at the Chinnaswamy for his next match to pay tribute to his red-ball career. The encounter was rained off but the sentiment remained: an appropriate display of affection for a player who had revitalised the home crowd's love for five-day cricket, yet ended his career with an average of 30.72 in his final 39 Tests.

If a hint of what could have been remained about his Test career - ending with 9230 runs, the least prolific among the Fab Four - he seemed to be at peace with what was. He would soon go on to win the IPL trophy for the first time, on his 18th attempt, and declare the victory to still be "five levels under Test cricket".

Kohli is a world champion multiple times over, having captained India to the 2008 Under-19 World Cup title and winning four more ICC trophies with the senior side: the 50-over World Cup in 2011, Champions Trophies in 2013 and 2025, and the 2024 T20 World Cup, where he scored 76 in the final.
